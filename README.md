# Microsoft Azure Security Case Project  
### Case Project: Securing Cloud Infrastructure with Microsoft Azure  

## Overview  
This project is a **hands-on case study** completed as part of advanced training in **Microsoft Azure Security Technologies (AZ-500)**. The goal was to gain practical experience securing various components in an Azure environment using a series of challenge labs mapped to real-world scenarios.

## Objective  
The project aims to strengthen cloud security skills by implementing identity protection, platform security, data encryption, and security operations using Azure tools and services. Each lab aligns with one of the core modules of the **AZ-500 certification path**.

## Scenario  
As a cloud security administrator, I was tasked with configuring and managing secure cloud infrastructure for a fictional organization. I implemented 10 security-focused tasks to protect applications, networks, and data hosted on Microsoft Azure.

### **Task 01: Configure Authentication for an Azure Web App**  
- Enabled secure user authentication  
- Integrated identity management using Azure AD  

### **Task 02: Configure Virtual Network Connectivity Using Peering**  
- Connected virtual networks across regions  
- Ensured secure inter-resource communication  

### **Task 03: Configure an Application Security Group**  
- Created and applied ASGs to isolate workloads  
- Controlled traffic flow between Azure resources  

### **Task 04: Configure Network Security for Application Traffic**  
- Defined inbound/outbound security rules  
- Validated secure application connectivity  

### **Task 05: Configure Azure Disk Encryption**  
- Enabled BitLocker-based encryption for Azure managed disks  
- Used Azure Key Vault for key management  

### **Task 06: Enable Database Auditing with Azure SQL Database**  
- Configured auditing policies  
- Monitored access and activity logs  

### **Task 07: Manage Shared Access Signature (SAS) Keys**  
- Generated SAS tokens with defined scopes and lifetimes  
- Applied security best practices for SAS key usage  

### **Task 08: Configure Monitoring Using Azure Monitor**  
- Set up metrics and log collection  
- Created performance and health dashboards  

### **Task 09: Configure Application Insights and App Service Logs**
